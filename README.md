### Malawian Programmer

- 👋&#127997;  Hie, I'm Chisomo Chiweza (She/Her). I'm a Malawian polyglot programmer (🇲🇼).
- 🛠️ Whilst I like to explore what I can build with different programming languages - I've also been interested lately in how we can engineer better software.
- ✍️ I write about my thoughts and experiences engineering software in Malawi. Check out [A Malawian Programmer's blog](https://malawianprogrammer.notion.site/A-Malawian-Programmer-s-blog-00ecb817ea14446a9a0456c78758f425?pvs=4).
